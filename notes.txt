geoserver has a csw plugin to publish metadata about its services

pycsw is used by other services

mapstore has a CSW parser, but to get service urls, it uses record attribute dct:references, for example:
<dct:references scheme="OGC:WMS">https://gs-stable.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/wms?service=WMS&request=GetMap&layers=test:Linea_costa</dct:references>
and publishes <dt:type> to be: http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset
<dc:type>http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset</dc:type>
It seems this CSW record is created by geoserver

nationaalgeoregister uses dc:URI for service references
<dc:URI protocol="" description="accessPoint">https://service.pdok.nl/cbs/vierkantstatistieken100m/2007/wfs/v1_0?request=GetCapabilities&service=WFS</dc:URI>

OpenSearch is an alternative? to CSW
